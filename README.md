This repo contains project and solution files for building GMP library for Windows using Visual Studio.

The solution is able to build both static and dynamic libraries in debug and release configurations for x64 architecture

The actual gmp sources are included in a subfolder packages/gmp

At the moment generic C implementation for mpn is used.

Tested version: 6.3.0
